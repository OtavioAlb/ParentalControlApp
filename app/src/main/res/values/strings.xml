        \n

        Toy by Company are certified by the iKeepSafe Seal Program. To learn more, visit ikeepsafe.org.
        \n\n
        Toys are built on top of a platform certified to UL-2900-2-2 standard for Cybersecurity.
        \n\n
        We use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological methods to transmit your data securely
        including HTTPS, SSL, and 128bit encryption. The data is stored using Amazon’s S3 cloud service (AWS infrastructure).
        While Amazon provides security around that infrastructure which prevents unauthorized access to it, just being on AWS
        does not guarantee security. Our engineers have implemented AWS in a fashion that enables us to avail of proper security
        processes.
        \n\n
        Company follows all the best practices when it comes to security. We secure our infrastructure accounts, servers and
        databases with complex protocol and passwords. We preform automated deployments and security upgrades in order to
        minimize any possible "user error" when performing maintenance or upgrades.
        \n\n
        We would like to stress again that we take the security of your data very seriously. In addition to taking all of the
        precautions and following best practices on our end, we have had independent third-party entities audit our system for
        security vulnerabilities, as well as follow COPPA compliance procedures.
        \n\n
        If you have any questions, please let us know. We\'re here to help!
        \n\n
        <b>What personal information is collected from children under 13?</b>
        \n
        Users under 13 are expected to use the Company app under their parent/guardian\'s account. As a result, we do not
        knowingly collect emails or other contact information directly from children under 13. When children use Company app,
        audio recordings are captured as part of its use.
        \n\n
        <b>What controls do parents have over account information and content?</b>
        \n
        Children under 13 are not authorized to create their own accounts, but instead must use their parent\'s account. Therefore,
        parents have full control over all account information and content for children under 13. Parents may review and delete
        audio files in their account and may also permanently delete their accounts by emailing us at team@company.com.
        \n\n
        When you set up your app user account, your password is encrypted. If you need to reset your password, you will need to
        confirm it via e-mail.
